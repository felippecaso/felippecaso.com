I'm a facilitator, musician, analyst and engineer. I prefer dogs to cats, and on the weekends I read about mixology. I'm passionate about technology and self-knowledge, and I like to combine the two to be a bit better every day.

I help businesses and people to make sense of data, currently leading part of the Analytics team at [Loft](https://www.loft.com.br). I'm a teacher and mentor in data, programming and career development since 2016.

I graduated in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos, with an exchange program to Queen Mary, University of London in Audio Systems Engineering, combining and old artistic side to the vocation to the exact sciences. I was part of teams in data and technology in startups since my second undergraduate year.
