I’m a facilitator, musician, analyst, and engineer. I prefer dogs over cats, and on weekends I enjoy reading about mixology. I'm passionate about technology and self-knowledge and strive to combine them to improve myself day after day.

I help businesses and individuals make sense of data. Currently, I work as a Lead Analytics Engineer at [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br), after spending the past four years leading the Analytics team at [Loft](https://loft.com.br). Since 2016 I have been teaching and mentoring in data, programming, and career development, in partnership with organizations such as [Fundação Estudar](https://estudar.org.br/).

I graduated from the Federal University of São Carlos with a degree in Electrical Engineering, and I participated in an exchange program at Queen Mary University of London, where I studied Audio Systems Engineering - it allowed me to combine my artistic side with a passion for exact sciences. Since my second year of undergraduate studies, I've been a part of data and technology teams in startups.
