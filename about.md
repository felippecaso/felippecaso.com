I’m a facilitator, musician, analyst, and engineer. I prefer dogs over cats, and on weekends I enjoy reading about mixology. I am passionate about technology and self-knowledge and strive to combine the two to improve myself every day.

I help businesses and individuals make sense of data. Currently, I lead part of the Analytics team at [Loft](https://www.loft.com.br), and since 2016 I have been teaching and mentoring in data, programming, and career development.

I graduated from the Federal University of São Carlos with a degree in Electrical Engineering, and I participated in an exchange program at Queen Mary University of London, where I studied Audio Systems Engineering - it allowed me to combine my artistic side with a passion for exact sciences. Since my second year of undergraduate studies, I have worked on data and technology teams in startups.
